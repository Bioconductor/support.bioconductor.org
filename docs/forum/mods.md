# Moderator guidelines

Thank you for being a moderator. Your contributions and participation on Biostar is being recognized by providing you with extended rights over the site's operation.

### Contacting other moderators

A private Slack Channel is used as the primary means of communicating with other moderators.

Participation is optional. As a moderator you are welcome to join at any time.

The Moderator Log page has an invite to the **Biostar Moderator Slack Channel**.

### Moderator rights

Moderators may:

- Edit other readers' posts (for formatting purposes only!)
- Delete and restore content
- Suspend and reinstate users
- Reorganize content on the site (answers/comments)
- Bump posts to higher visibility
- Mark posts as off-topic
- Mark posts as spam. 

Please be generous with your powers and use them only when necessary and in a minimally obtrusive manner. No action is destructive and every action may be reverted.

### Editing posts

Moderators may only edit a post to:

1. fix a typo in a command, a URL or an image
2. format code or content to become more readable

The author of the post should be responsible for the readability and tone of the post. 

Editing a post generates a diff.  The diff is not visible to the site's users, it is stored in a file as a log, and would be used only to resolve potential disagreements with regards to what a post originally contained. These diffs may be periodically removed and are not archived long term.

### Deleting posts

Posts that break the rules of civil communication will be deleted. Users that submit such posts may be suspended or banned with no prior notice.

### Post moderation

Every moderation action generates a log entry in the moderation log.

* Delete - marks the post as deleted, only mods and the author can see the post
* Open - removes deleted flag from a post
* Bump - sets the timestamp to be among the first ten posts
* Off-topic - adds the offtopic tag and creates a comment stating that the post if off topic.
* Spam - marks post as spam, suspends post author
* Not spam - unmarks post from spam, reinstates post author 
 
### Commercial posts

Users may post commercially motivated posts to the Forum section as long as the topic aligns with the main focus of this
site. 

### Marking post as spam

Marking a post as spam suspends the author of the post.

## Off topic content

Try to be generous in your assesment on what constitutes "off-topic" content.
 
Bioinformatics is a broad field, often it is hard to tell what is a bioinformatics and what is "pure programming" or "statistics". Usually it is effective and more constructive to point readers to the appropriate source instead of informing them that the post is off topic.

Marking a post off topic generates a comment (and a notification to the user).

Off topic content may be periodically removed.

### User reputation

The number next to a user's name is the sum of upvotes and accepted answers that user has collected.

### Becoming a moderator

Active users above a certain reputation threshold are periodically promoted to
moderators. 

You may also self nominate and ask for moderation rights or suggest good
candidates on the Slack channel. Inactive users that do not visit the site for
extended periods of time may lose their moderation rights.
